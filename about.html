    <span>Background</span>

    <p>The Applied Technology Innovators (ATI) was created to transfer theoretical knowledge obtained in classroom to practical knowledge. The group promotes projects in the fields of technology, business, science and engineering that, at the end of each project, generate scholarships for students by raffling or selling the final product. For the initial project, ATI members decided to build a go-kart from a lawnmower engine. With the help of modified equipment and knowledge, ATI members were able to convert a vertical shaft engine into a horizontal shaft engine by modifying the fuel injection and manual lubrication system. The group worked closely with nonprofit organizations and through this interaction ATI concluded the high need for scholarships. Based on the need for scholarships, ATI is intended to develop a go-kart with a push start system, fuel pump, speedometer, modified intake/exhaust system, and electrical safety switches that would attract the attention of potential buyers. ATI shall be presenting the final product in 2015</p>
    <span>Objective</span>

    <p>The primary purpose of this presentation is to illustrate the role of engineering, science, business, and technology through the go-kart project. Additionally, the presentation will serve students as a motivation to achieve a higher education in STEM careers. In order to achieve the objective, students are going to be exposed to engineering, mathematical, and science concepts that explains the operating principles of an engine from an engineering perspective. This go-kart project is rich in conceptual and critical thinking topics that will help the students become critical thinkers.</p>

   <span> Materials</span>

    <p>To successfully increase the interest of students in STEM careers, the engine and go-kart frame will be presented to students. Therefore, the conceptual principles will be illustrated verbally and physically.</p>
